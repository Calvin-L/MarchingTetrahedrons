// The exact GLUT include differs by platform: on MacOS it is <GLUT/glut.h>,
// while on Windows and Linux it is <GL/glut.h>.  CMake, which knows the
// correct value for GLUT_INCLUDE_DIR, uses this template to produce a generic
// include header that directs to the right one, whichever it is.
//
// Because we're just including another header, we don't even need the typical
// #ifndef guard.

#include <@GLUT_INCLUDE_DIR@/glut.h>
