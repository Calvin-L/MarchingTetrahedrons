Marching Tetrahedrons Implementation

--------------------------------------------

This is an implementation of the "marching tetrahedrons"
algorithm for OpenGL. The project was written on Mac OS X,
but should be easily portable to other operating systems.

The implementation is not ultra-performance intensive, but
was instead written as an easy-to-understand demo.
