Marching Tetrahedrons Implementation

--------------------------------------------

This is an implementation of the "marching tetrahedrons"
algorithm for OpenGL. The project was written on Mac OS X,
but should work on Linux and Windows as well.

The implementation is not ultra-performance intensive, but
was instead written as an easy-to-understand demo.

Important files:
    main.cpp           program entry point
    Isosurface.h       parent class for renderable surfaces
    Decimate.h         declaration of the actual algorithm
    Decimate.cpp       implementation of the actual algorithm

To build the "MarchingTetrahedrons" executable (requires CMake):
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    cmake --build .
